These are (some of) my dotfiles.  I hope you find them useful.

Note #0:

  This collection is incomplete, and consists only of configurations which can
  be published.  Naturally I have other files or sections which need to remain
  private, for various reasons.

  The private configurations are held in a separate repository, which also
  contains scripts for merging files from both repositories and then installs
  the resulting configurations onto all machines I have access to.

  There's nothing particularly special kept private, and I hope to keep as much
  of it public as possible.

Note #1:

  Some files are written in m4.  This allows me to include other (possibly
  private) files inline, or change contents based on which site I am pushing
  the configuration to.  If you want to use these files, you'll need to:

   - strip the .m4 suffix
   - remove m4_ sections (you can pass them through GNU m4 using -P for this..)
   - fix up any fallout, e.g. if you don't use the same -Dfoo as me

As the "copyright" at the top of each file says, I really appreciate feedback
on any of this stuff, even letting me know that you discovered something new
from one of them would be great!
